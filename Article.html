<p><b>FRANZ LEE RAMOS</b><p>was born in Llanera, Nueva Ecija. At three months old he moved to a small town in Manila, the Philippines where was raised by his parents. After taking a slew of classes in Top Link Global College Parsons School of Photography,
 and the International Center for Photography, he came home to Llanera and promptly staked his claim on the city's burgeoning fashion industry, producing a formidable body of work that includes some of the era's most memorable fashion and celebrity images.
 <p>In 2019, he condensed the milestones of the first few years of his career in the book Push: Muses, Mischief, & How to Make it in Manila, which became an instant bestseller and social media sensation. Today, not only is he one of the countryâ€™s most in-demand photographers but he is also an increasingly popular social media personality in his own right- appearing in several magazines covers himself, and working with brands like Calvin Klein, Samsung, Loewe, and Addidas.</p>
  <p>His work has become omnipresent among the pages of the country's leading publications - having shot over 300 magazine covers thus far - as well as countless billboards and ads for major brands in the Philippines. Aside from being highly requested by the
  top local celebrities, he has also turned his lens on international personalities like Elsa Hosk, Coco Rocha, Sky Ferreira, Pietro Boselli, Noah Centineo, and Troye Sivan.</p>
   <p>Currently, due to the pandemic, he started to take a chance to review for the Civil Service Exam in the reason of he want to be a law enforcer.</p>
